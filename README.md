# KRYPTOS

Here is a guide to the algorithmic solutions of K1, K2, and K3.

Hopefully this will enlighten some people new to Kryptos to the solutions.

## How to use:

* install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* download this project
* inside the project folder (in a terminal) type:
  - `npm install`

Now you can use various Javascript files via:
`node solution1.js`
and you will get the proper output.

These algorithms are very simplistic to maintain readability. Mostly just for loops and modular arithmetic. Some high level functions like split and join you see for solution3 can be explained [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) with the methods (functions) on the right hand side.
